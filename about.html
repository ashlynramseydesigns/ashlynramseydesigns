                I've always been the one to sit back and 
                observe my family members, which leads me 
                to say I've always been adamant about 
                setting my path.

                I graduated my High School in Charleston, 
                SC, and ended up moving to Savannah, GA 
                shortly after. For a while, I just couldn't 
                decide what I wanted to do with my life. 
                Then, one day I was watching a YouTube video 
                that involved a drawing of a celebrity, which 
                got me thinking, "What about graphic design?" 
                I grabbed my computer and started searching 
                for schools offering graphic design which is 
                where I found my college F.I.R.S.T. Institue. 
                After a few months, I decided to move to 
                Wisconsin with my now fiance and family. 
                Still attending F.I.R.S.T online. Growing up 
                I was always around music and artsy things. 
                Music has always been a passion of mine. 
                Leading me to say that singing is my hobby 
                and a big part of my life. Meeting new people 
                growing up I was anxious and scared, I still 
                am at times. Ever since I've become a student 
                at F.I.R.S.T. that's brought me out of my 
                shell. However, I do love a good stay-at-home 
                in bed bingeing on my shows, and watching movies 
                all day.
